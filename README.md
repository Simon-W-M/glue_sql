# glue_sql
Quick demo of how to use glue features with sql script to be able to run dynamic sql queries in R.  This gives the ability to dynamically select columns and tables to be included in a query.  

**NOTE** I have not included my personal credentials or warehouse name in this script.  You will have to point this at your own warehouse and provide your own credentials.
